Executive summary
Many people enjoy capturing the visual, historical, and experiential contexts that landmarks offer as they travel around the world.
These individuals, however, use disjoint resources to plan trips, reducing the quality of the narrative experience they receive when visiting a place.
To facilitate the description of a place and create a shared experience of that place, we will create an Android smartphone application,
which allows users to explore basic facts, photographs, historical details, and travelersâ€™ experiences regarding Bosnian Heritage and 
Cultural Sites. Android application is allowing users to discover recommended places near their current location. The content is managed
at the backend which is coded in JAVA or PHP script. They are perfect solutions to build a location based app which has important modules 
such as user review, rating, distance calculation, contact, etc. 


Project overview and goals
Our aim is to develop robust tourist and travel Android application that will serve tourists throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina and will 
contain all data and facts important for tourists and visitors of our country.
Most of the rare travel and tourist applications available in Bosnia today only display a map with indication of some tourist attractions 
and historical sites that tourists can visit. They do not offer any smart scheduling or schedule optimizing features to assist the user
in planning their day, by presenting the user with an optimized itinerary. For our project, we propose the development of a smart day 
planner tourist application, which provides the user with an optimized schedule, taking into account various constraints like 
appointment times, activity durations, activity locations, travel modes and distances.
We will also consider, if there is enough time, development of trip planner that combines all transportation modes to find 
you the best routes: walking, bus, train, rail, Uber, taxi & cab and bike share. All in real-time, including bus and train 
schedules and disruptions.
